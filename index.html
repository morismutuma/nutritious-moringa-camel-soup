        <h2>About Our Soup</h2>
        <p>
            I have run the camel soup business in cooperation, Uthiru, Nairobi, Kenya for four years.
            Our guests kept praising the Camel Bone Soup blended with the Magical Moringa Powder, they said it healed Arthritis, boosted their immunity and energy instantly.
            Camel bones, preparing nutritious bone broth, packaging it safely, and selling it to customers who value traditional, medicinal, and high-energy foods. This business is growing in regions where camel meat is common such as East Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, and parts of the Middle East.
            Three years ago, a customer who had been sick for weeks said it was the only thing that helped.

        <p>
            That’s when I realized: <strong>this is not just soup it’s medicine.</strong>
            Now we are bringing it from our hotel kitchen to homes across Kenya.
