        <h2>About Our Soup</h2>
        <p>
            I have run the camel soup business in cooperation with Uthiru in Nairobi for four years. 
            Our guests kept raving about my moringa camel soup. They said it healed colds and boosted energy. 
            Three years ago, a customer who had been sick for weeks said it was the only thing that helped. 
            That’s when I realized it isn’t just a soup — it’s medicine.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we are bringing it from our hotel kitchen to homes across Kenya.
